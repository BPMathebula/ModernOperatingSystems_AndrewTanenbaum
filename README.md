 One of my first tasks on the road to become <em>BareMetalDev</em> was reading
  the praised book by <strong>Andrew Tanenbaum</strong> and <strong>Herbert Bos</strong> - <em>"Modern Operating Systems"</em>
  . It is a great source of knowledge about operating systems - how they work and operate.

Of course there is no way to just read the book and remember at least a part of it. Therefore, I've decided to make
 notes along the way. My first learning experience - preparing for the **RHCSA** exam, resulted in notes 
 and questions too - I've <a href="https://github.com/chlebik/rhcsa-practice-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
 published them in a separate GitHub repository</a>. It became really successful, proving that there is always a 
 demand for good quality learning materials. Based on that, I've decided to also publish my notes from the aforementioned 
 book.

It is still **work in progress**, although the amount of knowledge already published is quite wide. I won't 
lie that increasing number of GitHub stars does not improve my morale ;) What is more - using GitHub - allows other
 people to participate in this work, fixing bugs or explaining something through the PRs. Collaboration is power.
